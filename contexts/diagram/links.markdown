*Nassi–Shneiderman diagram (NSD)*

In computer programming, a Nassi–Shneiderman diagram (NSD) is a graphical design representation for structured programming. Developed in 1972 by Isaac Nassi and Ben Shneiderman, these diagrams are also called structograms, as they show a program's structures.

*A short history of structured flowcharts (Nassi-Shneiderman Diagrams)*

Ben Shneiderman (Draft: May 27, 2003)

The fascinating history and evolution of structured flowcharts (usually called Nassi-Shneiderman Diagrams or structograms) goes back to 1972. As a graduate student, I got the idea while attending an ACM organized talk in New York by Michael Jackson on structured programming. If GOTOs were to be avoided, then shouldn't the lines in old flowcharts be avoided as well. Fifteen minutes of sketching led to the first ideas of sequence, conditionals and iteration.

Returning to Stony Brook, fellow graduate student Isaac Nassi shaped the ideas based on his more in-depth knowledge of structured programming principles. Together we wrote the original paper, which was quickly rejected for publication in the Communications of the ACM. So we sent it to the unrefereed ACM SIGPLAN (Special Interest Group on Programming Languages) Notices where it appeared in August 1973.
