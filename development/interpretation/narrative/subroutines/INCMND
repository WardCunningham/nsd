Keyset chords appear as 5-bit values where the least-significant bit corresponds to the right-most (thumb) key.

A bit-pattern match in LCMN leads to a corresponding jump to the statement numbers found in the computed goto.

New nodes are inserted above or added to the selected node. The thumb inverts these commands to be the corresponding delete.
