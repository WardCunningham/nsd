As the mouse moves, we move the cursor (a circle) and select a region of the drawing to be operated on by, say, INCMND.

Potentiometers within Engelbart's original mouse produced an analog voltage which was then read through the Imlac's analog-to-digital converters. Analog noise made the mouse jumpy and hard to use. This was damped by maintaining position history in NXP & NYP. With each invocation, 1/5 of these values was updated with fresh input.

The diagram recursively subdivided the screen space. TRACKR would find the deepest subdivision that included the current (dampened) mouse position. This was highlighted by drawing a second box around it.

The data structure node so identified was recorded somehow yet to be recalled.
